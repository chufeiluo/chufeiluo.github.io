Hi! I'm a PhD student at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. My main area of research is applying the latest advancements in NLP to high-stakes tasks, with a focus on interpretability and reasoning. I used to be a software developer at IBM and I'm very interested in how NLP can be used in the industry!

Supervised by Dr. Xiaodan Zhu and Dr. Samuel Dahan.
